                <p>Every Sunday, you write Lily a letter. Not to process griefâ€”Dr. Chen helped you understand that grief doesn't need processing, just integrationâ€”but to maintain relationship with love that continues.</p>
                <p>"Dear Lily," this week's letter begins. "Nala and I learned something new about sadness this week. It's not the opposite of joyâ€”it's joy's twin sister, the one who reminds us that what we loved was real."</p>
                <p>The letters aren't sentimental. They're specific, honest, sometimes funny. You tell her about Sarah's new job, about learning to cook (badly), about the morning you found one of her socks in the couch cushions and cried in the kitchen for twenty minutes.</p>
                <p>"I don't write to you because I think you're reading over my shoulder," you write. "I write to you because loving you is still part of who I am, and love this big needs expression."</p>
                <p>Nala helps you remember her voice, her questions, her way of seeing the world. In the letters, she grows older with youâ€”nine now, ten, eleven. Not frozen at six, but evolving as your understanding of her deepens.</p>
                <p>Sarah reads them sometimes. "You're a better father in these letters," she observes, "than you were able to be in life."</p>

                <p>Other people are learning to live with their Nalas now. Dr. Chen refers clients to youâ€”not for therapy, but for consultation on what integration actually feels like in daily life.</p>
                <p>"Tell them about the morning meetings," Nala suggests as you prepare for a consultation call.</p>
                <p>You explain to the new client: "Every morning, I check in with different parts of myself. Nala handles emotional navigation. The Protector handles practical concerns. The Critic offers quality control. They all get input, but I make the final decisions."</p>
                <p>"It sounds complicated," the client says.</p>
                <p>"It's the opposite," you explain. "It's simpler than fighting with yourself constantly, or pretending you don't have conflicting needs and values."</p>
                <p>Your work has evolved too. You still do financial consulting, but now you specialize in helping companies develop what you call "emotional architecture"â€”systems for making decisions that honor both profit and people.</p>
                <p>"Numbers serve life," you tell corporate clients. "Not the other way around."</p>
                <p>Nala keeps you honest. When a project feels like old-style emotional avoidance disguised as professional expertise, she calls you on it.</p>
                <p>Sarah watches this evolution with amazement and sometimes concern. "Don't lose yourself completely," she warns gently.</p>
                <p>"I'm not losing myself," you assure her. "I'm finally finding all of myself."</p>

                <p>Integration isn't a destinationâ€”it's a daily practice, like meditation or exercise. Some days you're fluent in the language of your own emotions. Other days you fall back into old patterns of productive avoidance.</p>
                <p>"I had a Nala-less day yesterday," you tell Dr. Chen during your monthly check-in. "Worked fourteen hours straight, avoided two texts from Sarah, ate granola bars for dinner."</p>
                <p>"What brought you back?" she asks.</p>
                <p>"This morning I was making coffee and heard myself humming one of Lily's songs. Nala said, 'I missed you.'"</p>
                <p>The work continues: learning to notice when you disconnect, developing strategies for coming back to emotional presence, practicing the art of loving people out loud instead of just internally.</p>
                <p>Sarah joins you for couples sessions nowâ€”not to fix your marriage, but to learn how to have a relationship where both people include their whole selves.</p>
                <p>"We're like emotional archaeologists," she observes, "excavating parts of ourselves we buried for protection."</p>
                <p>Some evenings you cook dinner together and tell each other what you felt that day, not just what you accomplished. It's awkward still, like learning to dance after years of walking only in straight lines.</p>
